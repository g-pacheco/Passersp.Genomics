               birds, and is possibly induced by environmental and social cues.
               Although such behavioral plasticity has been hypothesized to be
               controlled by adult neuronal plasticity, empirical evidence,
               especially at the neurogenomic level, remains limited. Here, we
               aim to uncover the gene regulatory networks that govern avian
               nest construction and examine whether they are associated with
               circuit rewiring. We designed an experiment to dissect this
               complex behavior into components in response to pair bonding and
               nest material acquisition by manipulating the presence of mates
               and nest materials in 30 pairs of zebra finches.
               Whole-transcriptome analysis of 300 samples from five brain
               regions linked to avian nesting behaviors revealed
               nesting-associated gene expression enriched with neural rewiring
               functions, including neurogenesis and neuron projection. The
               enriched expression was observed in the motor/sensorimotor and
               social behavior networks of female finches, and in the
               dopaminergic reward system of males. Female birds exhibited
               predominant neurotranscriptomic changes to initiate the nesting
               stage, while males showed major changes after entering this
               stage, underscoring sex-specific roles in nesting behavior.
               Notably, major neurotranscriptomic changes occurred during pair
               bonding, with minor changes during nest material acquisition,
               emphasizing social interactions in nest construction. We also
               revealed gene expression associated with reproductive behaviors
               and tactile sensing for nesting behavior. This study presents
               novel neurogenomic evidence supporting the hypothesis of adult
               neural plasticity underlying avian nest-construction behavior. By
               uncovering the genetic toolkits involved, we offer novel insights
               into the evolution of animals' innate ability to construct nests.",

               insights gained from that work and song learning before it, it
               seems that it might also be useful to try to add some
               neurobiology to other systems in animal cognition. I finish then,
               with a description of recent work on the cognition and
               neurobiology of avian nest building. It is still relatively early
               days but asking questions about the cognition of nest building
               has already shown both neural correlates of nest building and
               that learning and memory play a much greater role in this

               learned to locate the correct flower independent of absolute

               adding a vertical component to the learning/memory of a spatial

               by rufous hummingbirds, Selasphorus rufus, of a rewarded location
               in the vertical and horizontal axes. We found that their ability

               between the flowers in the array. Birds chose the flower in the

               horizontal array but only when flowers were spaced 30 cm apart.
               In contrast, in the vertical array or when the flowers were 5 cm

               flowers. In addition, the cues the birds used to learn the

               location whereas at 5 cm they chose the relative and absolute

              on flawed assumptions of homology to mammals. In particular, the
              outdated terminology implies that most of the avian telencephalon
              is a hypertrophied basal ganglia, when it is now clear that most
              of the avian telencephalon is neurochemically, hodologically, and
              functionally comparable to the mammalian neocortex, claustrum, and
              pallial amygdala (all of which derive from the pallial sector of
              the developing telencephalon). Recognizing that this promotes
              misunderstanding of the functional organization of avian brains
              and their evolutionary relationship to mammalian brains, avian
              brain specialists began discussions to rectify this problem,
              culminating in the Avian Brain Nomenclature Forum held at Duke
              University in July 2002, which approved a new terminology for
              avian telencephalon and some allied brainstem cell groups. Details
              of this new terminology are presented here, as is a rationale for
              each name change and evidence for any homologies implied by the
              new names. Revisions for the brainstem focused on vocal control,
              catecholaminergic, cholinergic, and basal ganglia-related nuclei.
              For example, the Forum recognized that the hypoglossal nucleus had
              been incorrectly identified as the nucleus intermedius in the
              Karten and Hodos (1967) pigeon brain atlas, and what was
              identified as the hypoglossal nucleus in that atlas should instead
              be called the supraspinal nucleus. The locus ceruleus of this and
              other avian atlases was noted to consist of a caudal noradrenergic
              part homologous to the mammalian locus coeruleus and a rostral
              region corresponding to the mammalian A8 dopaminergic cell group.
              The midbrain dopaminergic cell group in birds known as the nucleus
              tegmenti pedunculopontinus pars compacta was recognized as
              homologous to the mammalian substantia nigra pars compacta and was
              renamed accordingly; a group of gamma-aminobutyric acid
              (GABA)ergic neurons at the lateral edge of this region was
              identified as homologous to the mammalian substantia nigra pars
              reticulata and was also renamed accordingly. A field of
              cholinergic neurons in the rostral avian hindbrain was named the
              nucleus pedunculopontinus tegmenti, whereas the anterior nucleus
              of the ansa lenticularis in the avian diencephalon was renamed the
              subthalamic nucleus, both for their evident mammalian homologues.
              For the basal (i.e., subpallial) telencephalon, the actual parts
              of the basal ganglia were given names reflecting their now evident
              homologues. For example, the lobus parolfactorius and
              paleostriatum augmentatum were acknowledged to make up the dorsal
              subdivision of the striatal part of the basal ganglia and were
              renamed as the medial and lateral striatum. The paleostriatum
              primitivum was recognized as homologous to the mammalian globus
              pallidus and renamed as such. Additionally, the rostroventral part
              of what was called the lobus parolfactorius was acknowledged as
              comparable to the mammalian nucleus accumbens, which, together
              with the olfactory tubercle, was noted to be part of the ventral
              striatum in birds. A ventral pallidum, a basal cholinergic cell
              group, and medial and lateral bed nuclei of the stria terminalis
              were also recognized. The dorsal (i.e., pallial) telencephalic
              regions that had been erroneously named to reflect presumed
              homology to striatal parts of mammalian basal ganglia were renamed
              as part of the pallium, using prefixes that retain most
              established abbreviations, to maintain continuity with the
              outdated nomenclature. We concluded, however, that one-to-one
              (i.e., discrete) homologies with mammals are still uncertain for
              most of the telencephalic pallium in birds and thus the new
              pallial terminology is largely devoid of assumptions of one-to-one
              homologies with mammals. The sectors of the hyperstriatum
              composing the Wulst (i.e., the hyperstriatum accessorium
              intermedium, and dorsale), the hyperstriatum ventrale, the
              neostriatum, and the archistriatum have been renamed
              (respectively) the hyperpallium (hypertrophied pallium), the
              mesopallium (middle pallium), the nidopallium (nest pallium), and
              the arcopallium (arched pallium). The posterior part of the
              archistriatum has been renamed the posterior pallial amygdala, the
              nucleus taeniae recognized as part of the avian amygdala, and a
              region inferior to the posterior paleostriatum primitivum included
              as a subpallial part of the avian amygdala. The names of some of
              the laminae and fiber tracts were also changed to reflect current
              understanding of the location of pallial and subpallial sectors of
              the avian telencephalon. Notably, the lamina medularis dorsalis
              has been renamed the pallial-subpallial lamina. We urge all to use
              this new terminology, because we believe it will promote better
              communication among neuroscientists. Further information is

               pre-dawn twilight. Thus, during nest location and prospecting,

               the latter become less salient in the low-light conditions when
               the nests are visited for laying. This raises the question of how
               these different sources of information interact, and whether this
               reflects different behavioural specializations across sexes.
               Differences are expected, because in shiny cowbirds, females act
               alone, but in screaming cowbirds, both sexes make exploratory and
               laying nest visits together. We trained females and males of

               phylogenies to examine how this variation was related to 13
               ecological and life-history variables. The ancestral state was
               probably tropical, resident, forest cuckoos with parental care.
               The evolution of brood parasitism was correlated with a shift to
               more open habitats, a change in diet, increases in species
               breeding-range size and migration, and a decrease in egg size.
               Once parasitism had evolved, more elaborate parasitic strategies
               (more harmful to host fitness) were correlated with decreased egg
               size, a change in diet, increased breeding-range size and
               migration, a shortened breeding season and a decrease in local
               abundance. Establishing the most probable evolutionary pathways,
               using the method of Pagel, shows that changes in ecological
               variables (such as migration, range size and diet type) preceded
               the evolution of brood parasitism, which is likely to be a later
               adaptation to reduce the cost of reproduction. By contrast, brood
               parasitism evolved before changes in egg size occurred,
               indicating that egg size is an adaptive trait in host--parasite

              has been hypothesized to evolve via natural selection [2, 6-8],

              neurogenesis is a well-preserved feature throughout the animal
              kingdom. In birds, ongoing neuronal addition occurs rather
              broadly, to a number of brain regions. This review describes adult
              avian neurogenesis and neuronal recruitment, discusses factors
              that regulate these processes, and touches upon the question of
              their genetic control. Several attributes make birds an extremely
              advantageous model to study neurogenesis. First, song learning
              exhibits seasonal variation that is associated with seasonal
              variation in neuronal turnover in some song control brain nuclei,
              which seems to be regulated via adult neurogenesis. Second,
              food-caching birds naturally use memory-dependent behavior in
              learning the locations of thousands of food caches scattered over
              their home ranges. In comparison with other birds, food-caching
              species have relatively enlarged hippocampi with more neurons and
              intense neurogenesis, which appears to be related to spatial
              learning. Finally, migratory behavior and naturally occurring
              social systems in birds also provide opportunities to investigate
              neurogenesis. This diversity of naturally occurring memory-based
              behaviors, combined with the fact that birds can be studied both
              in the wild and in the laboratory, make them ideal for
              investigation of neural processes underlying learning. This can be
              done by using various approaches, from evolutionary and
              comparative to neuroethological and molecular. Finally, we connect
              the avian arena to a broader view by providing a brief comparative
              and evolutionary overview of adult neurogenesis and by discussing
              the possible functional role of the new neurons. We conclude by
              indicating future directions and possible medical applications.",

              = 17 post-mortem samples from controls; n = 12 surgical resection
              samples from patients with epilepsy), young neurons were not

              found in early postnatal life, but this diminished during juvenile
              development as neurogenesis decreased. We conclude that
              recruitment of young neurons to the primate hippocampus decreases
              rapidly during the first years of life, and that neurogenesis in
              the dentate gyrus does not continue, or is extremely rare, in
              adult humans. The early decline in hippocampal neurogenesis raises
              questions about how the function of the dentate gyrus differs
              between humans and other species in which adult hippocampal
              neurogenesis is preserved.",

               recover these caches throughout the winter. We previously showed

              compelling evidence for the significance of natural selection in
              evolution, as the emergence of similar adaptive solutions is
              unlikely to occur by random chance alone. However, these terms are
              often employed inconsistently, leading to misinterpretation and
              confusion, and recently proposed definitions have unintentionally
              diminished the emphasis on the evolution of similar adaptive
              solutions. Here, I examine various conceptual frameworks and
              definitions related to parallel and convergent evolution and
              propose a consolidated framework that enhances our comprehension
              of these evolutionary patterns. The primary aim of this framework
              is to harmonize the concepts of parallel and convergent evolution
              together with natural selection and the idea of similarity. Both
              concepts involve the evolution of similar adaptive solutions as a
              result of environmental challenges. The distinction lies in
              ancestral phenotypes. Parallel evolution takes place when the
              ancestral phenotypes (before selection) of the lineages are
              similar. Convergent evolution happens when the lineages have
              distinct ancestral phenotypes (before selection). Because an
              ancestral-based distinction will inevitably lead to cases where
              uncertainty in the distinction may arise, the framework includes a
              general term, repeated evolution, which can be used as a term
              applying to the evolution of similar phenotypes and genotypes as
              well as similar responses to environmental pressures. Based on the
              argument that genetic similarity may frequently arise without
              selection, the framework posits that the similarity of genetic
              sequences is not of great interest unless linked to the actions of
              natural selection or to the origins (mutation, standing genetic
              variation, gene flow) and locations of the similar sequences.",

               types, which are considered indispensable for hippocampal
               function. However, functionally similar hippocampi exist even in
               non-mammals that lack an obvious entorhinal cortex or, generally,
               any layered cortex. To address this dilemma, we mapped extrinsic
               hippocampal connections in chickadees, whose hippocampi are used
               for remembering numerous food caches. We found a well-delineated
               structure in these birds that is topologically similar to the
               entorhinal cortex and interfaces between the hippocampus and
               other pallial regions. Recordings of this structure revealed
               entorhinal-like activity, including border and multi-field

  abstract  = "Although the hippocampus is structurally quite different among
               reptiles, birds, and mammals, its function in spatial memory is
               said to be highly conserved. This is surprising, given that
               structural differences generally reflect functional differences.
               Here I review this enigma in some detail, identifying several
               evolutionary changes in hippocampal cytoarchitecture and
               connectivity. I recognize a lepidosaurid pattern of hippocampal
               organization (in lizards, snakes, and the tuatara Sphenodon) that
               differs substantially from the pattern of organization observed
               in the turtle/archosaur lineage, which includes crocodilians and
               birds. Although individual subdivisions of the hippocampus are
               difficult to homologize between these two patterns, both lack a
               clear homolog of the mammalian dentate gyrus. The strictly
               trilaminar organization of the ancestral amniote hippocampus was
               gradually lost in the lineage leading to birds, and birds
               expanded the system of intrahippocampal axon collaterals,
               relative to turtles and lizards. These expanded collateral axon
               branches resemble the extensive collaterals in CA3 of the
               mammalian hippocampus but probably evolved independently of them.
               Additional examples of convergent evolution between birds and
               mammals are the loss of direct inputs to the hippocampus from the
               primary olfactory cortex and the general expansion of
               telencephalic regions that communicate reciprocally with the
               hippocampus. Given this structural convergence, it seems likely
               that some similarities in the function of the hippocampus between
               birds and mammals, notably its role in the ability to remember
               many different locations without extensive training, likewise
               evolved convergently. The currently available data do not allow
               for a strong test of this hypothesis, but the hypothesis itself
               suggests some promising new research directions.",

               species sampled, phylogenetic method and the choice of genomic
               regions1-3. Here we address these issues by analysing the genomes
               of 363 bird species4 (218 taxonomic families, 92\% of total).
               Using intergenic regions and coalescent methods, we present a
               well-supported tree but also a marked degree of discordance. The
               tree confirms that Neoaves experienced rapid radiation at or near
               the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary. Sufficient loci rather than
               extensive taxon sampling were more effective in resolving
               difficult nodes. Remaining recalcitrant nodes involve species
               that are a challenge to model due to either extreme DNA

              quantify total numbers of neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the
              brain or any dissectable regions thereof. It consists of

              isotropic suspensions of cell nuclei, which can be counted and
              identified immunocytochemically as neuronal or non-neuronal.
              Estimates of total cell, neuronal, and non-neuronal numbers can be
              obtained in 24 h and vary by <10\% among animals. Because the
              estimates obtained are independent of brain volume, they can be
